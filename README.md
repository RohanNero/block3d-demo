## Block3d Demo

![image](./public/block3d-infographic.png)

This demo is very simple and only consists of two pages.

1. "/" - the main page/route is public and includes a button to the only other page, "/private".
2. "/private" - this page is not marked in the `publicRoutes` section in the `block3dConfig` and thus can only be viewed by users who meet the rule criteria. In this case, you must hold 1 USDC on either Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum, Base, or Polygon.
